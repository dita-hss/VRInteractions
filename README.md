# VRInteractions Final Deliverable

This interactions project focuses on the different types of weapons one may encounter in VR.

## Core interactions implemented 

**1. Gun**
   - When the user uses a gun-like weapon, they must manually reload the weapon after a certain number of shots.

**2. Javelin**
  - When the user throws a javelin weapon, the user can use one controller to aim and release the throw.

**3. Throwing Knives**
  - When users use basic throwing weapons (i.e. throwing knives), they can do so by quickly flicking the controller. The knife's trajectory depends on the angle and velocity of the flick.

**4. Bow and Arrow**
  - When users use a bow-like weapon, the user must pull back the drawstring with one controller and aim with the other controller. The farther the string is pulled, the stronger the shot is.

# Observations

Duing testing, I noticed that a lot of the testers struggled with the javelin. It seems that none of the testers were able to make a successful throw on the first attempt. A successfoul throw being one where the javelin itself reaches or gets near one of the 'targets' in the scene. After the initial throw, all the testers looked straight down and reacted in a way that implies that the javelin did not travel any distance and simply landed near their feet. After a few attempts, all testers were able to successfully throw the javelin. However, only 2 were able to do with ease having significant distance with little effort. The other 3 testers over emphasized their throws to attempt to get significant distance and still struggled to get distance. I wonder whether the instructions may not have been clear or whether there is just a learning curve. Another observation is that all testers really enjoyed the bow and arrow. They noted that the increasing intensity of vibrations as you increased the pull of the string really added to the experience. Additionally, people spent the least amount of time testing the gun. This may be due tot the lack of realism. The shooting and reloading mechanism were oversimplified to where the user simply clicks two different buttons to do each action. This was also the weapon that most people had experience with in the VR world which may have contributed to it. Lastly, people seemed to have less trouble with the throwing knives despite having a similar mechanism to the javelin. Most did not even note any sort of difficulty with the throwing knives when they noted difficulty with the javelin.

Based on these observations, a change that I may implement include improvement on how the javelin is thrown to make it appear less 'heavy' and require less energy/force from the user. Another change would be to make the gun weapon more involved whehn shooting and reloading in order to improve user experience.  

## Pre-Test Questions
1. Have you used this type of VR interaction before?
2. Which interaction are you most excited about and why?
3. Can you perform the interactions before you put on the headset, which interaction do you think would be the most difficult to replicate in a VR environment?

## Post-Test Questions
4. Which interaction felt the best to you in the VR world?
5. Which interaction felt the most accurate to when you attempted the interaction outside of VR?
6. Do you have any thoughts on improvements to any of the interactions?

## User Responses to Pre/Post Questions
### User 1
1. Iâ€™ve used a gun type weapon.
2. The javelin because it sounds unique.
3. The bow because it seems like there are more moving parts.
4. Bow and arrow
5. gun
6. Kind of hard to throw the javelin, it feels like it requires a lot of energy.

### User 2
1. Not in VR, but I have seen the weapons being use in different sort of games.
2. The knives because it reminds me of the hunger games.
3. I would assume the gun because i imagine reloading by chucking the gun to the side or taking something apart.
4. The bow and arrow - the vibration strength increasing and decreasing based on the pull distance was cool.
5. The knife throw
6. It didn't feel natural to press the trigger to release the javelin or the knives.

### User 3
1. No, besides the initial VR game we did (p1)
2. Throwing knives and bow an arrow. They sound the coolest.
3. The javelin. It's difficult to think about how it would be done.
4. The javelin
5. The gun
6. The bow and arrow, it did not feel like both hands are as involved as they should be.

### User 4
1. Yes, guns in VR, bow and arrow maybe
2. The bow and arrow. It sounds like it would be the coolest to do in VR.
3. Probably the bow and arrow since it has more complexity and uses both hands.
4. The bow and arrow
5. the bow and arrow
6. The javelin was positioned at an odd rotation and use require less velocity to throw the javelin and throwing knives

### User 5
1. Yes, guns in VR 
2. Javelin
3. The javelin might be the hardest to make it work when and how its supposed to
4. The bow and arrow, the vibration played a big part to it
5. The bow and arrow and gun
6. The javelin feels weird to use, having to click the button feels weird - it might be better to click hold release
